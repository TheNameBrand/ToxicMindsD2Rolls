// Tusk of the Boar

// (PvE 2/5)
// Slice, Deconstruct
//notes:(2/5 Roll) Deconstruct on a waveframe means you can practically use this as a primary weapon in places with high minor ad counts like Onslaught, and Slice is the icing on the cake. Definitely need one of these before Final Shape. MW:Reload -CrazedChrizz|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame
